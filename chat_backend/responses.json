  "Give me optimization recommendations based on the above data": "1. Index Usage or Creation:\nSince the query is filtering on the `customer_id` column, which is indexed, it seems like the index is not being used effectively. The high average execution time and rows examined suggest that a covering index could help improve performance. A covering index includes all the columns needed for the query, so the table doesn't need to be scanned. In this case, you could create a covering index on `customer_id` including the necessary columns from the `orders` table.\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id_covering\nON orders (customer_id, needed_columns);\n\n2. Query Rewrite Opportunities:\nAvoid using SELECT * and explicitly list the columns needed in the query. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from the disk and can improve performance.\n\nSELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount, ... FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?;\n\n3. Table Partitioning or Materialized Views:\nSince the table is large (500,000 rows) and the query is filtering on a single column, table partitioning could be beneficial. Partitioning the `orders` table by `customer_id` would allow the database to read smaller, more manageable partitions instead of scanning the entire table.\n\nALTER TABLE orders PARTITION BY RANGE (customer_id) (\n    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1000),\n    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),\n    ...,\n    PARTITION pN VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE\n);\n\n4. Caching or Other Performance Improvements:\nCaching can help reduce the number of disk reads and improve performance for frequently executed queries. You can configure your database system to cache the results of this query for a certain period. However, caching might not be necessary if the data changes frequently, as the cache would become outdated.\n\nAdditionally, consider optimizing database configuration settings such as buffer pool size, query cache size, and connection pool size to accommodate the workload.\n\nadd Codeadd Markdown"
